Hey traveller!

My name is Adrien, and this blog is where I share my thoughts and progress throughout my journey as a developer.

I love solving problems and making the life of other people easier, which is exactly why I became a developer. I am currently working as a Lead Front-End Engineer at [Brigad](https://brigad.co). My philosophy, in life and at work, is to welcome new challenges with open arms and always try to learn something new from them.

I am also available for contract work, and you can see my skills [here](/skills) or contact me directly.

[Contributing](https://github.com/adrienharnay) to OSS is something I try to do often, and encourage others do, as it helps us becoming an even more awesome community!

Mentoring and supporting collegues and fellow developers is also something I love and enjoy doing on a daily basis. Don't hesitate to come at me with any question you would have!

I have been [playing drums](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVb5uS6xt5xzG0cojt3Yf1A?view_as=subscriber) for 5 years and particularly like discovering new artists and types of music.

If you want to get in touch with me, message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdrienHarnay?lang=fr) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrien-harnay/), or send me an [email](mailto:adrien@harnay.me)!
